Win Dot Files: Dotfiles for Windows

This repository is a quick and easy way to customize your windows system. It's a one liner! (almost...)

Steps to a great setup:

1. Open `[first_run.cmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valleyjo/win.files/master/first_run.cmd)`
2. Save as first_run.cmd on your desktop
3. Right click and run as administrator

Setup.cmd will take care of moving the settings files to their proper locations. You can run the setup.cmd file from time to time to ensure your various systems stay up to date.

NOTE: If you update your settings for an application, they must be copied from their actual location and put into this repo. Setup.cmd does not automatically pull updated setting files to this repo, it simply copies the settings files here into their respective locations.

Default software package:

1. ConEmu and Console2 windows terminal emulators
2. Google Chrome
3. vim
4. fiddler2
5. sublime text 2
6. procexp
7. f.lux
8. dexpot
9. Chocolatey


Also included:

1. .gitconfig (be sure to put your own name and email in it)
2. ConEmu and Console2 settings
3. _vimrc
4. .agignore
5. a few vim plugins and colorschemes
