Dotfiles for windows

This repository allows you to customize your windows system. It is designed to work out of the box and with one line. All you need to do is download and run `first_run.cmd`. It will take care of installing everything for you! It also swaps your control key and caps lock key.

Setup.cmd will take care of moving the settings files to their proper locations. You can run the setup.cmd file from time to time to ensure your various systems stay up to date.

NOTE: If you update your settings for an application, they must be copied from their actual location and put into this repo. Setup.cmd does not automatically pull updated setting files to this repo, it simply copies the settings files here into their respective locations.
